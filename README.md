# Friendly Captcha for WordPress (Fork)

## About this fork

### Adjustments

Related to [this discussion](https://github.com/FriendlyCaptcha/friendly-captcha-wordpress/issues/65), this fork allows to configure the friendly captcha backend server urls for the puzzle- and verify endpoints. This allows to use a self-hosted friendly captcha backend server or a proxy server.

Have a look at https://github.com/FriendlyCaptcha/friendly-lite-server if you're interested in self-hosting your own friendly captcha backend server.

### Install this fork

Currently there is no Wordpress Plugin available in the official WP store, so you will need to install and update this plugin manually via `.zip`-files (see [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/#upload-via-wordpress-admin) for more information). You can use the `create-zip.sh` script to create a `.zip`-file of this repository. Alternatively, have a look at the [releases](https://github.com/R0Wi/friendly-captcha-wordpress/releases) page and download the artifact from there.
